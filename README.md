# Energy Consumption Applicatiom

This is a Java Graphical Application that I created to show how to write and read data from binary and txt files in Java.

Situation: The existing problematic in a neighborhood where the residents of the same are being affected by the alteration of the reading of the kilowatt meter by an electricity collector. For that reason, the inhabitants of this place are paying more than what they should. The reports created by this app allow to see wich houses are actually paying more than what it should be, as well as the higher consumers.

Data Structure used: Linked Lists

Sorting algorithm used: Quicksort, an algorithm based on the divide and conquer technique, which allows to order n elements in a time proportional to n log n. This is the fastest known sorting technique, as it does not use additional memory in its recursive form.
